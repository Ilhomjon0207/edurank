EduRank

Information System for Analyzing and Ranking Students’ Academic Performance

General Information

Project type: Diploma (Graduation) Project
Project title: EduRank
Field: Information Technologies / Software Engineering

EduRank is a web-based information system developed as a diploma project. The system is intended for automated analysis and ranking of students’ academic performance in higher education institutions.

Relevance of the Project

Modern higher education institutions require objective and transparent mechanisms for evaluating students’ academic performance. Traditional assessment methods often do not provide a comprehensive view of a student’s competencies, which complicates the selection of qualified graduates by employers.

The development of an automated student ranking system helps improve transparency, reduce subjectivity, and strengthen the connection between education and the labor market.

Goal of the Project

The goal of this diploma project is to design and implement an information system for analyzing and ranking students based on academic indicators.

Objectives of the Project

Analyze existing student assessment systems

Study approaches to academic performance evaluation

Design system architecture and structure

Develop a web-based frontend application

Implement role-based access control

Provide tools for generating student rankings

Ensure system scalability and usability
